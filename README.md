## Development
```
Run the heart_beat.cpp file in an Arduino IDE.

Run the program.sh file in a separate IDE to read the console output from the Arduino.

The python scripts generate a graph at the end which is uploaded to a firebase.

Do npm start for the react project ecaff to see the real time update of the graph from firebase.
```
